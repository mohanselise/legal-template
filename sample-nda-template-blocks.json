      "A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement, is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between parties. It ensures that sensitive information shared between parties remains protected and cannot be disclosed to third parties without authorization.",
      "NDAs are essential for businesses engaging in partnerships, hiring employees, discussing potential deals, or sharing proprietary information. They provide legal recourse if confidential information is improperly disclosed, helping protect trade secrets, business strategies, customer lists, and other sensitive data.",
      "Our NDA generator creates comprehensive agreements that include standard clauses such as definitions of confidential information, obligations of the receiving party, exclusions from confidentiality, term and termination provisions, return of materials, and remedies for breach. Each agreement is tailored to your specific needs while maintaining legal enforceability."

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a mutual and unilateral NDA?",
        "answer": "A mutual NDA (also called a bilateral NDA) protects confidential information shared by both parties. This is common in joint ventures, partnerships, or when both parties will be sharing sensitive information. A unilateral NDA protects information shared by only one party, typically used when a company shares information with an employee, contractor, or potential business partner."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should an NDA last?",
        "answer": "The duration of an NDA depends on your specific needs. Common terms range from 1-5 years, though some agreements may extend indefinitely for trade secrets. Our generator allows you to specify the exact duration that makes sense for your situation. Consider the nature of the information—highly sensitive trade secrets may warrant longer terms, while project-specific information may only need protection for the project duration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is an NDA legally enforceable?",
        "answer": "Yes, NDAs are legally enforceable contracts when properly drafted and executed. However, enforceability depends on several factors including jurisdiction, reasonableness of terms, clarity of definitions, and whether the agreement was signed voluntarily. Our generator creates NDAs that comply with standard legal requirements, but we recommend consulting with an attorney for complex situations or high-stakes agreements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What information should be considered confidential?",
        "answer": "Confidential information typically includes trade secrets, business plans, financial data, customer lists, proprietary technology, marketing strategies, product designs, and any other sensitive business information. Our NDA generator allows you to specifically define what constitutes confidential information in your agreement, ensuring clarity and enforceability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this NDA internationally?",
        "answer": "Our NDA generator supports multiple jurisdictions and can be customized for international use. However, legal requirements vary by country. The generator includes jurisdiction-specific clauses, but for cross-border agreements, we recommend consulting with legal counsel familiar with the relevant jurisdictions to ensure full compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if someone breaches the NDA?",
        "answer": "NDAs typically include remedies for breach, which may include injunctive relief (court orders to stop disclosure), monetary damages, and in some cases, return of confidential materials. The specific remedies depend on the terms of your agreement and applicable law. Our generator includes standard breach provisions, but serious breaches should be addressed with legal counsel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a lawyer to create an NDA?",
        "answer": "While our generator creates legally sound NDAs based on standard templates, consulting with an attorney is recommended for complex situations, high-value agreements, or when dealing with sensitive trade secrets. For standard business NDAs, our generator provides a solid foundation that can be reviewed by legal counsel if needed."
